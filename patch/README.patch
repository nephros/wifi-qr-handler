# the actual source files are not included to avoid issues with copyright and
# licensing. IANAL but publishing a patch modification is one thing, publishing the
# whole thing another.
#
# To make changes:
#   mkdir -p a/usr/share/jolla-settings
#   cp /usr/share/jolla-settings/settings.qml a/usr/share/jolla-settings/settings.qml
#   cp -r a b
#   patch -p1 -d b/ < unified_diff.patch

# now edit b/foo
# finally do 'make' to update the diff
#
# don't forget to increase version and compatability tags in patch.json
