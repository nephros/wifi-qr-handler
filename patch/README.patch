README.patches

The actual source files are not included to avoid issues with copyright and
licensing. IANAL but publishing a patch modification is one thing, publishing the
whole thing another.

To make changes:

    mkdir -p a/usr/share/jolla-settings
    cp /usr/share/jolla-settings/settings.qml a/usr/share/jolla-settings/settings.qml
    cp /usr/share/jolla-settings/pages/wlan/mainpage.qml a/usr/share/jolla-settings/pages/wlan/mainpage.qml
    cp -r a b
    patch -p1 -d b/ < unified_diff.patch

Now edit b/foo.

Finally do 'make' to update the diff.
Don't forget to increase version and compatability tags in patch.json
